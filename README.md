# SSSM - Stupid Simple Server Monitor

## About

SSSM is an app to simply watch all of your servers at a glance. You can monitor RAM, Disk and keep up with your uptime in one simple dashboard.

You also have a single page for each one of your servers.

You can add as many servers as you want. And the setup is basically putting a crontab into your server to send SSSM monitoring data (checkout the code to see how it works).

There is also a group feature, so let's say your company has more people and you want to share your servers with them, you can just add them to your group.

## Hosted version

I personally host SSSM at https://sssm.app, using a DigitalOcean droplet with Ubuntu LTS.

All cost are on me and I do this for fun.

So, if you want to try it before hosting it for fun or just go out and use it, go ahead!

**It's free forever!**

## Open Source and Contributions
