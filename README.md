# SSSM - Stupid Simple Server Monitor

SSSM is an app to simply watch all of your servers at a glance. You can monitor RAM, Disk and keep up with your uptime in one simple dashboard.

You also have a single page for each one of your servers with simple but powerful charts.

You can add as many servers as you want. The setup is basically putting a crontab into your server to send SSSM monitoring data (checkout the code to see how it works).

There is also a group feature so you can share with your team.

## Hosted version

I personally host SSSM at https://sssm.app. All cost are on me and I do this for fun.

You can simply go to the URL and start using it or host yourself by building the project into a jar file.

## Open Source

The code in here available is free to modify and contribute. As the MIT license says, the project is open for anyone to modify and make changes as long as you keep the original credits.

You can create Pull Requests and I'll personally review it so it can go out for everyone!

## Donate

You can donate any amout to buy me a coffee or helping me maintain the server online.
